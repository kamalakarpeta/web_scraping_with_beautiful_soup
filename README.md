# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform web scraping using Beautiful Soup in a Jupyter notebook.

## Introduction
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. In this example, we will use the Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from a webpage. Specifically, we will scrape Wikipedia's list of 'The World's Billionaires' to gather information about the billionaires, such as their rank, name, net worth, age, citizenship, and source of wealth. We will then convert this data into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required for this analysis:
- Beautiful Soup
- requests
- pandas

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
## GitHub Repository
The code for this analysis can be found in the following GitHub repository: [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamalakarpeta/web_scraping_with_beautiful_soup)

## Conclusion
In this example, we demonstrated how to perform web scraping using Beautiful Soup in a Jupyter notebook. We imported the necessary libraries, chose a URL to scrape from, sent a HTTP request to the specified URL, created a Beautiful Soup object, found the table and rows within the table, iterated through the rows to extract the data for each billionaire, and converted the list of billionaires into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.

We then performed some basic analysis on the scraped data. We found the average age of the billionaires and identified the country with the most billionaires. Additionally, we determined the most common source of wealth among the billionaires.

Please note that this is a basic example of web scraping and analysis. Depending on the complexity and structure of the website you're scraping, you may need to adjust your code accordingly. It is important to always check the website's robots.txt file and respect the rules outlined there. Additionally, it is good practice to avoid overwhelming a website with rapid, repeated requests, as it can be seen as a denial of service attack.

Remember that web scraping can be a powerful tool for gathering data, but it is important to use it responsibly and ethically. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions and follow legal and ethical guidelines when scraping websites.

By following this example, you can apply web scraping techniques to gather data from other websites and perform various analyses based on your specific needs.
